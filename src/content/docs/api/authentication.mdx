All API requests require authentication using Bearer tokens.

## Getting API Keys

1. <a href="/request-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Request access to the Weyl API</a>
2. Fill out the access request form with your project details
3. Receive your API key via email within 24 hours
4. Store securely (keep the email safe for future reference)

## Using API Keys

Include your key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer wyl_sk_1234567890abcdef
```

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables

**Never hardcode API keys.** Use environment variables:

```bash
# .env.local
WEYL_API_KEY=wyl_sk_prod_1234567890abcdef
```

## Rate Limits

Rate limits are enforced per API key. Check response headers for current limits.
