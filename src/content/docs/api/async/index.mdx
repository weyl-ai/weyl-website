title: Async Tier Overview  
description: Queue-based generation
---

**Base URL:** `https://async.render.weyl.ai`

Queue-backed generation with CDN-arbitraged pricing.

## How It Works

```
1. POST /queue → 202 Accepted + job ID
2. Poll /jobs/{id} OR subscribe to SSE
3. GET /jobs/{id} → 303 redirect to CDN when complete
```

## Submit Job

```bash
curl -X POST "https://async.render.weyl.ai/queue" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $WEYL_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "modality": "image",
    "family": "flux",
    "model": "schnell",
    "task": "t2i",
    "format": "1024",
    "prompt": "cyberpunk cityscape"
  }'
```

## Check Status

```bash
curl "https://async.render.weyl.ai/jobs/j_abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $WEYL_API_KEY"
```

When complete, returns 303 redirect to the CDN URL.
