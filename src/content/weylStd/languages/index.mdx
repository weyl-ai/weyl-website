# Languages

**Weyl Standard** provides coding guidelines for production systems across multiple languages. Each standard optimizes for disambiguation, testability, and maintainability.

## Language Standards

| Language | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| [Nix](/std/nix/) | Reproducible infrastructure and builds |
| [Python](/std/languages/python/) | GPU inference and ML orchestration |
| [C++](/std/languages/cpp/) | Extreme performance requirements |
| [Haskell](/std/languages/haskell/) | Type-safe systems programming |
| [Rust](/std/languages/rust/) | Memory safety without garbage collection |
| [TypeScript](/std/languages/typescript/) | Web services and tooling |
| [Bash](/std/languages/bash/) | System automation and scripting |

## Core Philosophy

**Optimize for disambiguation, not brevity.**

In modern codebases where agents generate code and humans debug at 3am:
- Every ambiguity compounds exponentially
- Code is written once, read hundreds of times
- Grep-ability matters more than cleverness
- Type safety prevents tomorrow's bugs

## Shared Principles

All Weyl Standard language guides follow these principles:

- **Explicit over implicit** — No hidden behavior
- **Full words over abbreviations** — `configuration` not `cfg`
- **Grep-optimized naming** — Globally unique identifiers
- **Type safety** — Let compilers catch bugs
- **Property-based testing** — Invariants over examples
- **Structured logging** — Parseable, searchable output

The guides focus on production patterns that scale across teams and time.
