## Part III: Built Him up From Nothing in France

### Complementation, the FTTC, and the Holes in Your Iteration Space

<Callout type="info" title="Gibson's Armitage">

*"They'd walked into the Chiba construct, the scrambled and semiruined substrates of digital memory, and made him walk again. But he was still a puppet, his strings in the hands of Wintermute, the Villa Straylight's AI."*

</Callout>

Complementation answers: **"Given layout A in region [0,M), what layout B completes it without overlap?"**

This is the operation that lets you:
- Tile a tensor between thread blocks
- Split work between warps
- Ensure tensor core loads don't stomp on each other

---

### The fundamental formula (rank-1 case)

For a layout `A = (N) : (d)` within a memory region `[0, M)`:

**Complement:** `B = (d, M/(N·d)) : (1, N·d)`

Together they form:

**Tiled layout:** `C = (N, d, M/(N·d)) : (d, 1, N·d)`

This works because:
- A's coordinates `[0,N)` with stride `d` hit `{0, d, 2d, ..., (N-1)d}`
- B's first coordinate fills the gaps: `{0, 1, ..., d-1}`
- B's second coordinate tiles across the full region

<Callout type="warning" title="Divisibility Constraint">

**Critical:** This only works if `N * d ∣ M`.

If `M` is not divisible by `N * d`, you **cannot** complement without leaving holes or causing overlap.

</Callout>

### Connection to the FTTC

The Fundamental Theorem of TMA Correctness requires:

> When scheduling tensor core operations with TMA loads, the box size must divide the tensor size, and the element stride must divide the box size.

This is exactly the divisibility constraint for complementation!

NVIDIA's theorem tells you when you can safely split your iteration space. The complementation formula tells you **how** to construct that split.

### Lean 4: complementation with proof obligations

```lean4
def complement1 (N d M : Nat) (h : N * d ∣ M) : Layout :=
  [ { extent := d, stride := 1 },
    { extent := M / (N * d), stride := N * d } ]

theorem complement1_tiles (A : Layout) (N d M : Nat) (h : N * d ∣ M)
    (hA : A = [(N, d)]) :
  let B := complement1 N d M h
  let C := A.append B
  C.cosize = M ∧
  (∀ c₁ c₂, A.eval c₁ = B.eval c₂ → c₁ = c₂) := -- disjoint
  sorry -- proof that tiling is complete and non-overlapping
```

**The key:** The divisibility proof `h : N * d ∣ M` is part of the **type signature**.

You cannot call `complement1` without providing a proof that the constraint holds.

---

### Error messages from failed complementation

When you try to complement with invalid parameters:

```lean4
def badTile : Layout := complement1 128 16 2040 ?proof

-- Error: failed to synthesize proof that 128 * 16 ∣ 2040
-- Note: 2048 ∣ 2040 is false
-- Suggestion: use M = 2048 or M = 2032 with N = 127
```

The type system **rejects** invalid tilings at compile time.
